# HackerVerse Proposals
HackerVerse is a virtual coworking and events **Web3** platform where a creator or an engineer can create next generation products.
As an explorer or creator, you can explore multiple avenues in HV ranging from virtual offices (for rent and buy), events and hackathons, real-time collaborative work with companies & experts, as well as even fun hangouts with other explorers. We also incentivize creators to build products in our ecosystem. Companies collaborate with HV to set up their virtual offices, organize job fairs, hackathons, one on one recruitment, showcase their products & solutions and even give-away events.

## HackerVerse Proposal Standards
We are buidling several HackerVerse Company offices, Coworking spaces, Gaming Arenas, and Conference halls exclusively for creators. We propose to invite all idealists and fixers to build and launch your dream verse with us.

The proposal marked with **Green Label** with the highest likes will receive the Proposal incentives. The incentive allows the holder to signal for new space to be built by the Hackerverse team.
 
Before you get started, make sure to familiarize yourself with the 'HackerVerse Proposal Standard' along with what is alleged as a 'Qualifying Proposal' for submission. When ready, simply submit your proposal as a [new issue](https://github.com/hackerverse-io/hvproposals/issues/new) in this repository. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/hackerverse-io/hvproposals/issues) for examples. 

## HackerVerse Proposal Template

The Hackerverse Proposal Template is a template for proposals designed to ensure that submissions have been well thought through and contain a sufficient amount of supporting details for the community to make an informed decision in regards to its potential utility afforded. All proposals should be structured as follows:
- **Name**: Provide the name of the proposal. Ideally, this would also be listed in the issue title/description.
- **Purpose**: Define the purpose of the proposed space. Try to include a one-liner with an additional paragraph if needed.
- **Description**: Describe how the office/hangout zones should operate in detail.
Ethereum Address: Be sure it is an Ethereum address that you control the private key to or HVCoins sent to an exchange will be lost.

## Qualifying Proposals
To be considered as a 'qualifying proposal' the below conditions must be met:
- The proposal was submitted as an issue in the [Hackerverseio/Proposals repository](https://github.com/hackerverse-io/hvproposals)
- The proposal adheres to the Hackerverse Proposal Standard template as shared in [issues](https://github.com/hackerverse-io/hvproposals/issues).
- The proposal submitted doesn't violate any copyright or trademark regulations w.r.t any other such similar issue. 

Proposals not adhering to these standards will be closed out and the orange **'Invalid’** label will be attached.

## Proposals Incentives
To incentivize proposals of new space in Hackerverse, we offer to provide **1000 HVcoins** (check here, [what is HVCoin](https://hackerverse.io/hvcoin/)) to the winner of the most loved proposal. The closing date for this selection process will be dependent on activity within the registry and our roadmap progress.
The Hackerverse dev team will build the user-submitted office/space proposal. The winner will be designated as “HV Architect” and could also actively contribute to the code with our developers. Hackerverse highly believes in inspiring ideology, creativity, and efforts. Hence, even if the participants know a little about coding or don’t know to code, our dev team helps push their problem-solving and creative skills in the metaverse.

## Proposal Labels
Proposal Labels are used to highlight similar proposals as well as offer an easy way to collaborate. To expedite this, feel free to reach out to a community manager on Discord.
The following labels are active:
- Pink 'Duplicate' Label: This label indicates that a very similar proposal has already been submitted. A less thought-out or developed duplicate may be closed.
- Purple 'Elaborate' Label: This label will be added to a proposal if it needs more work and development or the market function is not clear. 
- Green ‘Potential’ Label: This will highlight the fact that a proposal has the potential of execution.
- Green 'Merge' Label: The ‘Merge’ tag is added for people taking the initiative to merge ideas and proposals into a single space. These proposals will be closed after an effort to collaborate and work on the new proposal has been finalized. To request an official "Merge", reach out to a community manager.
- Orange 'Invalid' Label: It will be added to proposals that do not adhere to the Hackerverse proposal standards outlined in the document. These proposals will be closed.
- Red 'Spam' Label: This tag will be to flag people who have been submitting spam proposals, refusing to respond to our inquiries, or refusal to adhere to proposal standards.Upon receiving the spam tag, your account will be blocked from interacting with the GitHub repo. Continued abuse in any form will result in a report to GitHub staff to investigate the account(s).

These labels and purpose are subject to change often and we will update everyone to those changes in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CzapuTafEA) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hackerverseio) Bulletin.
