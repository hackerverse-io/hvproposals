# HackerVerse Proposals
HackerVerse is a virtual coworking and events **Web3** platform where a creator or an engineer can create next generation products.
As an explorer or creator, you can explore multiple avenues in HV ranging from virtual offices (for rent and buy), events and hackathons, real-time collaborative work with companies & experts, as well as even fun hangouts with other explorers. We also incentivize creators to build products in our ecosystem. Companies collaborate with HV to set up their virtual offices, organize job fairs, hackathons, one on one recruitment, showcase their products & solutions and even give-away events.
## HackerVerse Proposal Standards
We are buidling several HackerVerse Company offices, Coworking spaces, Gaming Arenas, and Conference halls exclusively for creators. We propose to invite all idealists and fixers to build and launch your dream verse with us.

The proposal marked with **Green Label** with the highest likes will receive the Proposal incentives. The incentive allows the holder to signal for new space to be built by the Hackerverse team.
